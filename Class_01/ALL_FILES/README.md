# Introduction

## Hello guys!

![This is an image](https://github.com/teukuzaldi/Class_01/blob/main/Zaldi.png?raw=true)

I am **_Teuku Zaldiansyah_** this is my last semester of the MESM program 
in the `Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis track.`
I am quite interested in ~~agriculture, watershed, forestry, land use~~, drone, spatial analysis, 
and GIS/RS application in general.

[Quick Look]([https://github.com/teukuzaldi/Class_01/blob/main/Quicklook.png?raw=true](https://github.com/teukuzaldi/NRS-528-Python-in-GIS/blob/main/Class_01/Quicklook.png?raw=true))

Currently, doing research on tree risk analysis in Rhode Island using LiDAR data. 
My hobby is traveling, listening to music, and observing the stock market graph.

**Best,
Zaldi**
