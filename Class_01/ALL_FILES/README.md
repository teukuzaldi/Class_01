# 1 Introduction

Hi guys!

I am Teuku Zaldiansyah this is my last semester of the MESM program 
in the Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis track. 
I am quite interested in agriculture, watershed, forestry, land use, drone, spatial analysis, 
and GIS/RS application in general. 

Currently, doing research on tree risk analysis in Rhode Island using LiDAR data. 
My hobby is traveling, listening to music, and observing the stock market graph.

Best,
Zaldi
