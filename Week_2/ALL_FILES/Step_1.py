# Step 1 - Commenting in Python
#####

# The hash symbol is used to create a single line comment.

# You can use
# multiple lines
# if you want

# You can also turn
# a block of code
# into a comment by
# using PyCharm:
# 1. Select your block of code.
# 2. Select "Code" from the menu bar.
# 3. Select "Comment with Line Comment".
# 4. You can also reverse this using the same steps 1-3.

# Block comments in the form of something like
# /*
#     This is a JavaScript style block comment
# */
#
# are not generally used in Python.


# Commenting style is very user dependent, I want you to attempt to comment
# the small code block below. What kind of information do you feel is pertinent?


# This is small code example to iterate through two loops

list1 = ['Hi', 'Hello', 'Allo']
list2 = ['Bye', 'Goodbye', 'Au Revoir']

for i in list1:  # Run 1st and will run once until the 2nd repeat
    for z in list2: # Run all 3 then looping
        print(i + ' but its not ' + z)
