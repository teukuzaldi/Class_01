# You can list packages using the code:
# help("modules")

# # Importing packages is easy:
# import arcpy
# arcpy.AddMessage('arcpy loaded!\n')
# arcpy.AddMessage(r'arcpy loaded!\n')
#
# # You can also change the name of the package you load into something else:
# import arcpy as arcpython
# arcpython.AddMessage(r'I changed the name of arcpy\n')
#
# # You can import more than one package at once:
# import arcpy, os
# arcpy.AddMessage(os.listdir(r'c:'))
#
# # You can also be selective in your loading of various packages by using from:
from arcpy import AddMessage
arcpy.AddMessage(r'I only loaded AddMessage')
