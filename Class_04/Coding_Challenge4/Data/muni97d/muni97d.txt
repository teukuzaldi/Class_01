  Description:
    Abstract: Political boundary lines for Rhode Island municipalities with city and town feature attributes and name annotation including physical shoreline features for bay and coastal waters including islands and coastal ponds, State, county, city, and town boundaries
    Purpose: General mapping, graphic display and GIS analysis of Rhode Island state boundaries, including state, county, city, town, and coastal boundaries
    Supplemental_Information: Combined RIDOT state, county,  city and town lines with Intermap Technologies 5k coastal boundaries.  Internal terrestrial town boundaries are USGS 24:000 scale topo map boundaries modified for RIGIS 1:5000 road centerlines where defined as town boundaries.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        It was brought to our attention that there were 7 polygons that had no attribute information and did not belong to a town. FID 56 was determined to be part of Warren (based on emails with Town Planner and Harbor Master); appropriate attribute information was added. FID 333, 335 & 342 were deleted as they all represented water areas. FID 327 & 341 were determined to be part of South Kingstown and appropriate attribute information was added. FID 411 was deleted as it was determine to be a part of Stonnington, CT. Those changes resolved the 7 "un-named" polygons. The following were also deleted as they represented polygons of digitized water areas; since most coastal ponds and rivers were digitized to the shoreline (and excluded the water area), these were deleted for consistency throughout the state's coastline - FID 397, 342, 356, 310, 339, 133, 128, 66, 21, 16, & 10. 
        The metadata was updated to reflect these changes; other minor metadata updates were made.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The following edits were made: 
        1) Remaining water polygons were removed - FIDs: 14, 18, 21, 23, 24, 26, 34, 97, 104, 328, 356, 380, and 399.
        2) Gould Island (FID 78) was incorrectly categorized as Tiverton; this was switched to Portsmouth, and all muni-related attribute values were corrected. The proper Gould Island designation was received from Gary Crosby (gcrosby@portsmouthri.com) in the form of a parcel record of ownership. 
        3) Edited FID 12 (East Providence) to extend boundary to include missing land along the shoreline. Recalculated area and perimeter values.
        4) Created new feature, FID 395, to cover portion of Bold Point belonging to Providence. Calculated area and perimeter values. 
        5) Created two new features, FID 393 and FID 394, to cover the "Twin Islands" (Gingerbread Island and Pancake Island) and coded both with muni values for Providence. Calculated area and perimeter values for both.
